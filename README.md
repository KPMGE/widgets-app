# Widgets App

### Goal

This is a really simple React App. The main goal with that is to learn a bit more about Hooks in React
as well as its functional components. Moreover, in this app, I've understood more about how navigation works
by creating my own navigation from scratch.

### Screens

This App has 4 screens, the first one is an Accordion with some information about React.
The second one is the Search screen where you can put some term and search it on Wikipedia and,
if you want, you can jump into the original page from Wikipedia.
There is also a screen with a really simple Dropdown and lastly, a translate page, where you can
make yourself bilingual lol.

### Accordion
